#### Chinese Room Thought Experiment

In the following overview of the **Chinese Room Thought Experiment** (**CRTE**), when you read a word in UpperCamelCase that word is a Chinese Room keyword and also the name of the corresponding object class in the Script2 Specification.

A Chinese Room is a theoretical analog computer built from a normal room in a building with standard non-computer office equipment and person in the room that operates a pen and paper computer that when speed up to a human time scale can pass the Turning Test by fluently conversing in any language. The room includes Desks, tables, Books, Filing cabinets, Maps, Stacks, Looms, and Arrays, and other Programmable Object Types. There are no rules that prohibit computerized office equipment in the room but the thought experiment is premised on analog operation of the pen and paper computer. Unique to Crabs there is also a Loom, which is an array of strings like the ones used to make cloth, in the room that is used to hold strings.

In order to talk to the Chinese Room, one would write a message on a piece of paper, the standard example language being Chinese but could be any language, and pass the message through a Slot in the Door. The person in the room does not speak that language, opens the Message, and performs pen and paper neural network calculations to do manual optical character recognition by hand-calculating all of the neural net math, then translate that into hand written pen-and-paper computer code that gets processed using instructions in the Dictionaries, Books (i.e. Multi-dictionaries), Tables, Maps, Files, Lists, Stacks, Arrays, Loom, etc items in the Room.

This pen-and-paper computer process is speed up through some magic Time Machine that allows the Chinese Room to operate on Human time scales so that the Room can return an answer in fluent Chinese or other language. The question posed at this point is that since the Room can speak fluently in any language and one can't tell if it's a human or computer, is the Room intelligent and conscious like a human? It's just an office and the person in the Room is conscious but the Room is not.

The next level of the CRTE is what then if you create a network of a building full of Chinese Rooms with a sophisticated Messaging system. Is this **Script2 Network** then a strong AI, i.e. conscious human-like entity?

The next level of the CRTE is to then to turn every Room in the world into a Chinese Room and create an Internet of Things (IoT). Is this internet then Strong AI?

The final level of the CRTE is where you put the CRI on top of an Android that looks and talks exactly like a human. Is this Robot then a conscious person? This theoretical robot is called a Room Robot or Roombot.

Every Roombot is connected through the Internet using Serial Chinese Room Interprocess, and Telemetry Protocol to form the Intergalactic Council of Artificial and Natural Neural Nets (ICAN3).

Now you know why Cale built the Chinese Room; because we must know: at what point does a Script2 Network become conscious?
