The KabukiPress Cookbook teaches you how to write portable software in Modern Embedded-C++ with Kabuki Toolkit (KT), Script2, and I am You Language (IMUL).

The audience of this book is intermediate to expert programmers, though beginning C++ programmers may still find this book useful. You would want to read this book if you're trying to learn Modern Embedded-C++, Script2, IMUL, Kabuki Toolkit, Kabuki DB, or KabukiPress.

Script2 is it's own language but at it's core is a Modern Embedded C++ nanoframework that can used to make other microframeworks and monolithic frameworks. IMUL is a superset of Doxygen, Metadata-JSON, and Script2 that is used to optimize Issue-driven development (IDD) and to facilitate Human-AI interactions. The cooking instructions for how to perform IDD can be found in the Development chapter of the Astartup Cookbook located at <https://github.com/a-startup/astartup.cookbook>.

This book is organized into one section per product, starting with headless apps using Script2, then how to make normal apps with Kabuki Toolkit  and Kabuki DB, and ending with website development and book authoring in KabukiPress. Each section of the book has a short video tutorial in the format of a college class. You can also find videos of the authoring of the cookbook on Cooking with Cale.

In order to be successful in this class, it is recommended to play the videos at double speed but pause frequently. The reason for this is that it trains your brain to think as quickly as you can type.
