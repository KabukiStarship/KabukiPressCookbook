### Organization and Build System

[Section video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2vQG4gUE3vXWV_K9XScQw)

The core of the Kabuki Starship is the [**S**erial **C**hinese **R**oom, **I**nterprocess, and **T**elemetry (SCRIPT) Specification and Script2](../Script2). Scirpt2 is designed to be the core for both Software and Firmware development kits, which is why it is called a nanoframework. [Kabuki Toolkit (KT)](../kt/) is a Software Development Kit that adds tools to make portable apps web servers. Projects are typically broken up into a Service, a Client app, a Website, and a Cookbook.

This book focuses on creation of the KabukiPress Service, Client app, Website, and this Cookbook, and contains a link to a tutorial video for that section.

#### Kabuki Packages

Kabuki Packages use a minimalist format where all of the library code is in the root folder, this help make including source code easier and keeps the clutter down. All source code files begin with either an underscore or alpha-numeric number, and project files start with two underscores; this allows you to sort the files you want to include into your Visual Studio or other IDE project by name so you can quickly drag and drop the files into your solution/project.

#### Project File Structure

The most basic file structure possible is the Script2 Bootstrap project that contains:

* <https://github.com/kabuki-packages/kabuki.bootstrap_Script2.git>
  * `_seams` - This folder contains the software seams for the project.
    * `_main.cpp`, as the name implies, contains the entry point to the application.
    * `_impl.inl` - This file `#includes` all of the `.inl` tests.
    * `_debug.inl` - This file contains debug/test macros.
    * `_release.inl` - This file contains macros that are used when the package is not under test.
    * `_seams.inl` - This file contains the macros for the software seams the package.
    * `_undef.inl` - This file `#undef`the macros created in `_debug.inl` and `_release.inl`
    * `00.core.inl` - The unit test boilerplate code requires at least one software seam and you can rename this file to whatever you want.
    * `CMakeLists.txt` - This file builds `_main.cpp`.
    * `` - Every folder has a  file in it because it is **EXTREMELY** useful.
* `_impl.inl` - This file `#includes` all of the `.inl` inline implementation files into one translation unit.
