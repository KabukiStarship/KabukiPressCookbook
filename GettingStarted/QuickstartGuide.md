**1** Open a console pointed at your workspace folder. If you are creating one, it is advised to use `C:\Workspace` to preserve absolute filenames:

**1a** If you don't care about using a little bit more disk space, the easiest way is to clone the entire Kabuki Starship open-source workspace.

```BASH
git clone --recursive https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiStarship.git
```

**1.B** If you're low on disk space the other option is to only clone the KabukiPress repos.

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiStarship.git
cd KabukiStarship
git clone https://github.com/KabukiStarship/Script2.git
git clone https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiToolkit.git
git clone https://github.com/KabukiStarship/KabukiPress.git
```

**2.** Clone the Script2 Bootstrap:

```BASH
git clone https://github.com/KabukiPackages/Script2Bootstrap
```

**3.** Open the `__Script2.Bootstrap.sln` Visual Studio Solution file. If you do not already have Visual Studio installed you can download it for free at <https://visualstudio.com>.

**4.** To add KT to your project, you don't need to build a library because we use a method to dramatically reduce compile time called a Library translation unit. Rather than have `.cpp` files, we put the implementation in inline headers and you include them in your project in a separate translation unit. The dedicates a single CPU core to compiling each library. Create a file named `library.cpp` and in that file add the line:

```C++
#include <KabukiToolkit/_Module.inl>
```

**5.** In order to save the stack debug data when a D_ASSERT (Debug assert) occurs, set a breakpoint in the file `<Script2/Test.inl>` at the return line for:

```C++
BOL TestWarn(const CHA* function, const CHA* file, ISC line);
```

**6.** Compile the bootstrap and run, and read the following chapters for any unanswered questions.
