### Modern Embedded-C++

[Section video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2vQG4gUE3vXWV_K9XScQw)

Modern Embedded-C++ (ME-C++) is similar to Modern-C++ only there are some extra rules for dealing with memory constrained systems. Some of the most important characteristics of ME-C++ are:

1. Minimization of RAM and ROM use with the ability to scale up to desktop RAM and ROM usage using *Stack Programming* techniques to keep as much data as possible in the CPU registers and on the hardware-assisted stack. **✓**
1. Use of Virtual Machine design pattern to allow for easy porting to any hardware platform or OS. **✓**
1. Use of a detailed style guide with best practice and coding conventions. **✓**
1. Use of C++1x language features **where appropriate**. **✓**
1. Use of as much functionality at compile time as possible. **✓**
1. Use of a standardized set of general purpose data structures such as STL or ASCII Data Types. **✓**
1. Use of Issue Driven Development or competing best practice in order to remain agile using Continuous Integration Testing. **✓**
1. Smart pointers are used when dynamic memory is required unless performance is critical. **✓**
1. Use of minimized auto-generated API documentation using metadata tags such as Doxygen. **✓**
1. Code uses structured programming without Software exceptions with the exception of performance critical applications. **✓**
1. Libraries may integrate `Antiquated-C++`, meaning `C++` code that is not modern, but `Antiquated-C++` is wrapped with `Modern-C++ Adapters` and are segregated from the `Modern-C++` code and marked. **✓**
