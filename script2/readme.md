The **S**erial **C**hinese **R**oom, **I**nterprocess, and **T**elemetry Specification, or SCRIPT Specification for short, is a definition for a family of technologies based of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment and ASCII C0 Codes. Script2 is useful for creating all kinds of apps, games, operating systems, consumer electronics, computers, etc with. It was designed from scratch with a Sandwich Development Method to clean up and minimize the amount of code required to create apps as well as the memory and overhead processing using modern C++1x with cross-language bindings. Script2 specifies:

* [ASCII Data Types](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/tree/master/spec/data)
* [SCRIPT Protocol](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/tree/master/spec/crabs/)

Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Script, or Script2 for short, is a Modern Embedded-C++ nanoframework, which means that it is the core of an SDK that you can use to make many different types of Microframeworks, and the C++ nanoframework is used to create a Software-defined Networking Protocol (SDNP) defined in the [SCRIPT Specification](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/blob/master/spec). An SDNP is best described as a protocol for a plug and play ad-hoc Internet of Things similar to a mix of USB Human Interface Devices (USB-HID) with the Boarder Gateway Protocol.

Script2 uses a seam-oriented approach that allows you to break your software up into seams and test each seam in isolation similar to pealing back the layers of an onion.

The Automaton Standard Code for information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types are a set of POD and complex data structures that can define most commonly-used computerized data. ASCII Data Types support all of the C++ data types, UTF-8, UTF-16, and MSB Variant Encoding, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1024, 4096, and 4096, and 8192-bit signed and unsigned integers, 16, 32, 64, and 128-bit floating-point numbers, and a set of map data structures that use contiguous memory. The use of contiguous memory is very useful for interprocess communication and network apps. The data structures work as inter-process pointers that allows multiple processors to communicate and to perform reflections.
