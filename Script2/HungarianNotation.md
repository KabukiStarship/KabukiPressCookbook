### Hungarian Notation

[Section video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2vQG4gUE3vXWV_K9XScQw)

Hungarian notation is a naming convention in which the name of the class implies what data type is used to store the data. Post Hungarian Notation places the class name before the type name(s); for example `FooInt32 ()` implies that the function foo returns an `int32_t` type. Pre-Hungarian Notation places the type name before the class name; for example `Int32Foo ()`. The default endianness of Hungarian notation is Post-Hungarian notation.

F2 Software supports the use of Hungarian Notation to incorporate templated objects into Compliant UML Models. F2 software reserves the symbols UI, SI, and I for n-bit unsigned integer, signed integer, and either signed or unsigned integer, and T for a generic type. F2 software refers to all other data types as ASCII Data Types if an ASCII Data Type exists for that type.

```C++
// Class Foo_UI_SI_I with function Foo_SI2 translates to the following C++ class:

template<typename UI, typename SI, typename I>
struct TFoo {
    UI one;
    SI two;
    I  three;

    TFoo (UI one, SI two, I three) :
        one   (one  ),
        two   (two  ),
        three (three) {
    }

    template<typename Char>
    const Char* Bar () {
      static const Char kString[] = { 'A', 'S', 'C', 'I', 'I', '\0' };
      return kString;
    }
};

cout << Foo<uint32_t, int32_t, int16_t> (1, 2, 3).Bar<char> ();
```

### Assembly Line Boundary

An assembly in Assembly programming and C/C++ is a set of source code compiled into a single contiguous block of executable code using the C or similar calling convention. There are only two primary types of assemblies, precompiled libraries and executable files. The rule in C++ for libraries and DLLs is that a precompiled library may not include any other precompiled libraries, but a executable file may incorporate multiple precompiled libraries. This is because of the way that C++ does name mangling and setups up the static memory.
