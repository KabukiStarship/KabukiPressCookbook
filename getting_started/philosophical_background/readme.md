### Philosophical Background

[Section video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2vQG4gUE3vXWV_K9XScQw)

The bedrock of Scripts and Kabuki Toolkit™ are AI philosophy concepts of the Chinese Room and Kabuki Theater theory of consciousness. Having some knowledge of these theories are essential for continuing in AI.

#### Kabuki Theater Theory of Consciousness

Kabuki Toolkit™ is named after a famous artificial intelligence theory of consciousness called the Kabuki Theater Model of Consciousness. The Kabuki Theater concept is that our lucid consciousness is like viewing a Kabuki Theater in person; each actor on stage close up looks rather simple and imperfect, but when you put all of the actors and props on stage and place the viewer in a dark stage with stage lights focused on tiny portions of the stage in a controlled manner, it creates a Gestalt perception of consciousness where the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. On stage there are so many interesting things to look at that are far enough away you can't see their real-life imperfections, and it creates an illusion of lucid consciousness from your mind bouncing around all of the trippy stage props resulting in a saturation of the mind's short-term memory that tricks the mind into thinking it is a fluid experience.
